# Hello World

This is pretty sweet or something like that.
I dont really know what to write for my first post on my new blog, but it seems kinda cool.
This is the third attempt for me for writing, and i hope this will pan out much better than the other 2.

Ghost was a pain to maintain, because not only did i pay money for it, but i also failed to keep up with the SSL certificates / upgrades. This option had a lot of maintanence overhead.

Jekyll failed for me, when i started using windows.  It was very difficult to use without linux, which kinda ruined it for me.

On the other hand using Hugo, for blogging seems to check all of the boxes for me in terms of what i would need to get my writing out there, as easily as possible.
