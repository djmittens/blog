      <description>Hello World This is pretty sweet or something like that. I dont really know what to write for my first post on my new blog, but it seems kinda cool. This is the third attempt for me for writing, and i hope this will pan out much better than the other 2.
Ghost was a pain to maintain, because not only did i pay money for it, but i also failed to keep up with the SSL certificates / upgrades.</description>
