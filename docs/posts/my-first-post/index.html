<p>This is pretty sweet or something like that.
I dont really know what to write for my first post on my new blog, but it seems kinda cool.
This is the third attempt for me for writing, and i hope this will pan out much better than the other 2.</p>

<p>Ghost was a pain to maintain, because not only did i pay money for it, but i also failed to keep up with the SSL certificates / upgrades. This option had a lot of maintanence overhead.</p>

<p>Jekyll failed for me, when i started using windows.  It was very difficult to use without linux, which kinda ruined it for me.</p>

<p>On the other hand using Hugo, for blogging seems to check all of the boxes for me in terms of what i would need to get my writing out there, as easily as possible.</p>
