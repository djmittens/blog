## Philosophy - Why am i doing this?
### I find myself wanting to VLOG about coding quite often.
### I would like to get better at coding by doing very small and quick projects.
    This is mostly because i think that doing a vlog will actually help me follow through with the projects instead of letting them dangle unfinished, because this way i need them in a presentable state just so that i can actually finish a video.
    This strat will help me focus on the important stuff that helps me learn, rather than getting stuck polishing something for a long time without learning much more than what was there initially.
